\section{Information about missing data}
We have a total of $2.1\%$ of missing values but this number is overestimated because the binary indicators are taken into account. The real ratio is $1.7\%$
without this indicators.
The missing values are due to hardware problems related to the measuring instruments
and to the fact that the data was collected in a real environment.

To handle the missing values we will use for the rest of the project the complete case strategy.
Indeed, replacing missing data by the mean would not be a good idea because it would change the correlation structure of the data which is important for the next steps.
We only have 33 lines with missing values so we can afford to remove them keeping the ratio $\frac{n}{p} > 5$ as we have a total of 163 lines and 21 variables, we keep $7.8 > 5$.

Using the two figures here above we can see that the missing values are not randomly distributed.
Indeed, when there's a failure on the CO sensor, the NOx and NO$_2$ sensors are also failing a little bit after.
We can also see that when the NOx sensor is failing, the NO$_2$ sensor is also failing, this is quite logical because NO$_2$ is a kind of NOx.
Around the 175th observation, we can see the non methane hydrocarbons sensor failing and never quite coming to its original state. 
All these observations are confirmed by the second figure as the NMHC measure is the most missing well over the CO sensor or the couple NOx/NO$_2$ which is failling the same number of times.
