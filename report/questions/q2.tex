\section{Information about missing data}
We have a total of $2.1\%$ of missing values but this number is overestimated because the binary indicators are taken into account. The real ratio is $1.7\%$
without this indicators.
The missing values are due to hardware problems related to the measuring instruments
and to the fact that the data was collected in a real environment.
